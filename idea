per puzzle:
    1. make population of random move sets that get to solution
        1. grab random move set
        2. apply permutations and check if right
        3. if not go to step 1
        4. continue until right
    2. randomly select from the top N move sets (top being fewest moves to complete)
    3. combine random subsets of each move set to create more move sets (throw away if no solution found)
    4. keep top N move sets plus newly mutated move sets. Go to step 1.
